What is digital accessibility, and why does it matter?
- People with disability
- Users better accessbility (use website fully with either mouse or keyboard)
- People who has issues in their eyes (zoom should be break quality and resposbility of application)
- browser read the html which has accessbility given and it will generate accessbility tree for smooth experience.
-  Screen reader uses the tree
- Examples
    - aria-describedby
    - tab-index="0" => keyboard navigation (consider when we press tab)
        - [give other than -1 to skip from keyboard navigation]
        - 2 - 2nd tabs iteration
        - 3 - 3rd tabs iteration
    - Don't add role= "presentation" or aria-hidden= "true" to elements that need to have focus
    - alt or label for image or label-for
    - Symentic tags automatically managed accessiblity based on html5 tags
    - section with aria-label
