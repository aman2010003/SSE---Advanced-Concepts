Web Workers and Service Workers are both types of JavaScript Workers, but they serve different purposes and have different capabilities:

Web Worker:
Web Workers are used for performing heavy computations or executing large scripts without blocking the main thread.
They run in the background and can't access or manipulate the DOM directly.
This means they can't update the user interface. However, they can send messages back to the main script (which can update the UI),
using the postMessage method. They are designed to allow long-running scripts to execute without slowing down the user's browser.

Service Worker:
Service Workers act as programmable network proxies, allowing control over how network requests from your page are handled.
They are designed to enable the creation of effective offline experiences and intercept network requests and cache or retrieve resources
from the cache.
They can also handle push notifications and background sync processes. Unlike Web Workers, Service Workers can be terminated when not in
use and restarted when needed again, making them more efficient. 

In summary, while both run in the background and don't block the main thread, Web Workers are mainly used for offloading heavy computation
to a background thread, and Service Workers are primarily used for caching resources for offline usage and acting as a network proxy.
